INSTRUCTIONS

HOW TO BUILD (Linux environment):

1) Open a terminal and navigate to light_detection directory
2) In light_detection directory make a directory called build: "mkdir build"
3) Inside build directory enter: "cmake .."
4) Enter: "make"
5) To run the program enter "./light-detection path/to/img_captures/"

requires that cmake and gcc/g++ is installed
and OpenCV version 2 or 3
cmake version >= 2.8
settings in CMakeLists.txt: -std=c++11 -g -Wall -O0


HOW TO USE:

-the pics must be taken by vt-ip-camera/test/flashing_light_test.js. They will be saved in a directory
named by the location. inside will be img_captures/ 

-PROVIDE THE PATH TO img_captures if you want to use this program stand alone.
flashing_light_test.js will both take the images and apply this program automatically

-you can try it with the sample image sets in /light_detection/light_flashing/img_captures and /light_detection/light_not_flashing/img_captures
there is a place in process_images function where you can uncomment 2 lines to see a demonstration with target marking

-the return value of this program is 0 if it doesnt find a flashing light.
On success it will return 1 and the row, column coordinates of the light in the frame
(for row and col upper left corner is the origin, as in opencv)

-note: in node.js the "cout" output of this program is whats captured by the calling script
so this program cout's only what it is meant to return
